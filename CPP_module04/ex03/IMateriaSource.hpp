/*
 learnMateria(AMateria*)
Copies the Materia passed as a parameter and store it in memory so it can be cloned
later. Like the Character, the MateriaSource can know at most 4 Materias. They
are not necessarily unique.

â€¢ createMateria(std::string const &)
Returns a new Materia. The latter is a copy of the Materia previously learned by
the MateriaSource whose type equals the one passed as parameter. Returns 0 if
the type is unknown
